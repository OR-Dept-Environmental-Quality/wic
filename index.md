### The Waste Impact Calculator project and its repos

The Waste Impact Calculator (WIC) is a framework for estimating the life cycle environmental impacts associated with solid waste materials and treatments, and projecting the impact consequences of solid waste management decisions (e.g. comparing waste prevention to recycling).  See the *[Technical Overview of the Waste Impact Calculator](https://github.com/OR-Dept-Environmental-Quality/wic-base/blob/main/documentation/technical-overview-of-the-wic.pdf)* for rationale and approach.

WIC will published in several repos (not all of which are ready for prime time :) ). 

* [wic-base](https://github.com/OR-Dept-Environmental-Quality/wic-base) -- fundamental data and documentation, example applications
* wic-wastesheds -- calculation of life cycle impacts for solid waste in Oregon, Oregon's counties, and possibly several other states, under 3 management scenarios
* wic-app -- a shiny app for viewing the results produced by wic-wastesheds
* wic-eyo -- a shiny app allowing the user to enter their own data, and produce results similar to those produced by wic-app.

One personal note: while we the authors of WIC ([Martin J. Brown](https://github.com/DEQmbrown2) and [Peter Canepa](https://github.com/DEQpcanepa)) are experienced environmental analysts, and are quite confident in WIC's intellectual foundation, we're new to collaborative coding.  Please apply forbearance to our code/releases as necessary until we get the hang of this thing.  Thanks!
