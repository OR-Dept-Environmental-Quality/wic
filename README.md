The Waste Impact Calculator (WIC) is a framework for estimating the life cycle environmental impacts of solid waste, and projecting the impact consequences of waste management decisions (e.g. waste prevention vs. recycling).

See [WIC's github pages site](https://or-dept-environmental-quality.github.io/wic/) to learn about the several repos which make up the WIC project.
