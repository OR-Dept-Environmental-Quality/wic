The Waste Impact Calculator (WIC) is a framework for estimating the life cycle environmental impacts of solid waste, and projecting the impact consequences of waste management decisions (e.g. waste prevention vs. recycling).

This repo consists of a README and github pages link only.  It is a pointer to the several different repos that make up the WIC project.
